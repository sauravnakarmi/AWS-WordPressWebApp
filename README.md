# AWS-WordPressWebApp
Overview: This project aims to design and implement a robust, multi-tier WordPress web application infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS), incorporating Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Application Load Balancer (ALB), Relational Database Service (RDS), and Elastic File System (EFS). The primary goal is to achieve high availability and fault tolerance while maintaining scalability and security. I refrenced AOS notes tutorial when building this architecture (@AOS Note is his youtube channel).
